# YouTube Title Scraper

A Python automation tool that scrapes recent video titles from a list of YouTube channels using `Selenium` and `undetected-chromedriver`. It reads channel links from an Excel sheet, extracts up to 50 video titles per channel, cleans them using regex, and saves the final output to a new Excel file.

## Input

- `channels.xlsx`: Excel file with two columns:
  - `Channel Name`
  - `Channel Link`

## Features

- Scrolls through each channelâ€™s videos page to extract titles
